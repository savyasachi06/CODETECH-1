                                                                                OVERVIEW OF PROGRAM


This program is a C-based quiz game that prompts users to answer three multiple-choice questions, evaluates their responses, and provides a score along with feedback.

Key Features

	1.	Question and Answer Flow:
	•	Each question is displayed with four possible answers.
	•	The user enters the option number for their answer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).
	•	The program evaluates the user’s input and provides feedback (correct/incorrect).
	2.	Score Tracking:
	•	The program keeps a running tally of correct answers using the score variable.
	3.	Feedback System:
	•	After answering each question, users receive immediate feedback on whether they were correct and the correct answer if they were wrong.
	•	At the end of the quiz, the program displays a summary of the user’s performance:
	•	Full marks: “Excellent!”
	•	2/3 correct: “Great job!”
	•	1/3 correct: “Good effort!”
	•	0/3 correct: “Better luck next time.”
	4.	Simple and Interactive:
	•	Easy-to-follow instructions for users.
	•	Designed to handle basic integer input for answers.

Program Structure

	1.	Setup:
	•	Includes the stdio.h library for input and output.
	•	Initializes variables (score and answer).
	2.	Questions:
	•	Each question is presented with printf statements.
	•	The user inputs their answer using scanf.
	•	The input is validated using if statements, comparing the user’s answer to the correct option.
	3.	Scoring:
	•	Correct answers increment the score.
	•	Feedback is displayed after each question.
	4.	Final Output:
	•	Displays the total score.
	•	Provides a tailored message based on the user’s performance.

How It Runs

	1.	The program starts with a welcome message and instructions.
	2.	The user answers three questions sequentially.
	3.	After all questions, the final score and feedback are displayed.
	4.	The program ends gracefully with a return value of 0.

Potential Enhancements

	•	Input Validation: Ensure users only input numbers between 1 and 4.
	•	Dynamic Questions: Store questions in an array or file for easier updates.
	•	Randomization: Randomize the order of questions.
	•	Additional Features: Add more questions or implement difficulty levels.
 The program is a simple console-based quiz game implemented in C. It uses basic programming constructs such as conditional statements, input/output functions, and variables. The program is suitable for beginners who are learning how to handle user input and implement logical flow in C.
 This approach makes the program more modular and easier to expand.

By addressing the limitations and adding features, the program can evolve into a more robust and enjoyable quiz platform
